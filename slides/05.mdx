Data that comes in from the outside of a component is called
> "props" (properties)

This can be passed 
> from a parent to a child through JSX attributes

Props come into function components as 
> the first argument to the function.

```jsx
// Props as the first argument to the function
function Greeting(props) {
  return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
      </div>
  )
}

// Set a prop on a child component by passing an attribute
function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Greeting name="Jamal" />
            <div>
                <Greeting name="Islam"/>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```
