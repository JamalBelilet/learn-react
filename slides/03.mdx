# Components are functions that return JSX

- JSX looks like HTML but is actually JavaScript
- Inside of JSX use curly braces to contain JS
- A lot of people go "YUCK!" when they see HTML mixed into JS, 
    but JSX is actually one of the things that makes React awesome ðŸ¦„

```jsx
// regular function
function Greeting() {
  const name = "Jamal"
  return ( // Return JSX
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, {name}</h1> {/* Anything inside {} will execute as JS */}
        <p>How are you?!</p> {/* Use any HTML tag to build component */}
      </div>
  )
}
```
